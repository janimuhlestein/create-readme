# Run Buddy

## Description
A running program that aids the user in finding a personal trainer to assist them in increasing their running capabilities. Several different levels exist, allowing the user to get training help on a daily, weekly, or bi-weekly basis. This project came about because of the need, during these difficult times, for a virtual trainer.
